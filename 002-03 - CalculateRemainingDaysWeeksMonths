# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

# It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

# You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

# Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

# Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

# Example Input
# 56
# Example Output
# You have 12410 days, 1768 weeks, and 408 months left.

# There are 365 days in a year, 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year.

ExpectedAge = input("What is your current age? ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
age = input("What is your current age? ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡



# Converting input age to integer data type
Age_as_int = int(age)

# Calculating remaining age in years
Remaining_years = 90-Age_as_int


# Calculating remaining age in days(int data type).
Remaining_Days = Remaining_years * 365

# Calculating remaining age in weeks(int data type).
Remaining_Weeks = Remaining_years * 52

# Calculating remaining age in months(int data type).
Remaining_Months = Remaining_years * 12

# Less efficient method:
print("You have "+str(Remaining_Days)+" days, "+str(Remaining_Weeks)+" weeks, and "+str(Remaining_Months)+" months left.")

# More efficient method using F-String formatting
print(f"You have {Remaining_Days} days, {Remaining_Weeks} weeks, and {Remaining_Months} months left.")
